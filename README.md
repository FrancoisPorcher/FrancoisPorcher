# 👋🏻 Welcome to my GitHub!

Hi! I'm François, I am a PhD Student at Meta (FAIR) in the Segment Anything (SAM) team and Inria (Willow/THOTH).

Current vision architectures which rely on patch level embeddings lack an explicit knowledge of objects, interactions, physics understanding, and generalization abilities.

One objective of my PhD is to improve the perception and visual reasonning capacities of current architectures by exploring object-centric methods.

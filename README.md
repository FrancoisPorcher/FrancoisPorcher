# 👋🏻 Welcome to my GitHub!

Hi! I'm François, I am a PhD Student at Meta in the Segment Anything (SAM) team.

My ambition is to push the boundaries of AI by exploring **segmentation**, **representation learning**, and **self-supervised methods**—especially in highly impactful areas: Healthcare, Neurosciences, Ecology, and Energy.

## 🚀 About Me

- 🏢 Currently a PhD Student at Meta (FAIR) 2025 - 2028.
- 🎓 Alumnus of UC Berkeley (❤️☀️), where I earned my Master's degree in AI/Computer Sciences in May 2023.
- 📚 I also challenged myself to get a Master’s in Pure Mathematics from Paris Saclay, which is one of the toughest Mathematics curriculum. One of the toughest but most rewarding classes I have ever followed.
- ✏️ **Author**: I share insights and research on my [Medium Blog](https://medium.com/@francoisporcher).
- 🎸 **Hobbies:** I enjoy shredding on the electric guitar (Rock, Jazz and Funk), sports (🏋️‍♂️, 🏃‍♂️, 🏊‍♂️), and have recently started dancing rock. I also love learning new languages! (🇫🇷, 🇪🇸, 🇬🇧 fluently), and I’m currently focusing on 🇩🇪 and 🇮🇹.

## 🔭 Core Research Interests

- **Segmentation & Rare Object Detection**  
  methods to improve segmentation performance on images, videos, and rare/tiny/ambiguous objects.  
- **Generative Modeling**  
  Exploring generative models to enhance representation learning.  
- **Calibration & Uncertainty Estimation**  
  Refining models’ confidence scores, resolving ambiguity, and ensuring reliable predictions through calibration.  
- **Multimodal Integration & LLMs**  
  Combining large language models with visual architectures for next-level multimodal understanding and interpretability.

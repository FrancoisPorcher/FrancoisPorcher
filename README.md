# 👋🏻 Welcome to my GitHub!

Hi! I'm François, I am a PhD Student at Meta (FAIR) in the Segment Anything (SAM) team and Inria (Willow/THOTH).

I’m passionate about advancing general artificial intelligence in computer vision and develop a unified end‑to‑end model capable of complex tasks—reasoning, perception, image grounding and more.

## 🚀 About Me

- 🏢 Currently a PhD Student at Meta (FAIR) 2025 - 2028, under the supervision of Nicolas Carion, Karteek Alahari, Shizhe Chen.
- 🎓 Graduated at UC Berkeley (❤️☀️), where I earned a Master in Computer Sciences in May 2023.
- 📚 I also challenged myself to get a Master’s in Pure Mathematics from Paris Saclay, which is one of the toughest Mathematics curriculum.
- ✏️ **Author**: I occasionnaly share insights and research on my [Medium Blog](https://medium.com/@francoisporcher) when I have time.
- 🎸 **Hobbies:** I also play the electric guitar (mostly rock/jazz/funk), recently started dancing rock, and love to learn languages (🇮🇹 🇪🇸 🇬🇧 🇫🇷 🇩🇪)

## 🔭 Core Research Interests

- **Object Perception**
Object detection/segmentation in challenging scenarios, image grounding, object tracking.
- **Reasonning**
Visual Question Answering, scene understanding.
- **Unified vision model**
Integration of latest vision models like SAM in VLMs.

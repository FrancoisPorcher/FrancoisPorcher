# 👋🏻 Welcome to my GitHub!

Hi there! I'm François, a Research Scientist in Artificial Intelligence at Meta from 🇫🇷 and 🇪🇸

My ambition is to push the boundaries of AI, especially in highly impactful areas: Healthcare, Neurosciences, Ecology, and Energy.

## 🚀 About Me

- 🏢 Currently a Research Scientist intern at Meta (FAIR).
- 🎓 Alumnus of UC Berkeley (❤️☀️), where I earned my Master's degree in AI/Computer Sciences in May 2023. I also obtained Bachelor of Science in Engineering from CentraleSupelec.
- 📚 And for a bit of fun, I challenged myself to get a Master’s in Pure Mathematics from Paris Saclay, which is one of the toughest Mathematics curriculum. Was fun, but quite hard ngl haha
- ✏️ **Author**: I share insights and research on my [Medium Blog](https://medium.com/@francoisporcher).
- 🎸 Hobbies: I enjoy shredding on the electric guitar, hiking, and staying active with sports (🏋️‍♂️, 🏃‍♂️, 🏊‍♂️). I also love learning new languages! I currently speak 🇫🇷, 🇪🇸, 🇬🇧 fluently, and I’m currently focusing on 🇩🇪 and 🇮🇹.

## 🔭 Core Research Interests

- **Representation Learning**  
  Joint Embedding Spaces, Cross-modal integration.
- **Uncertainty Estimation**  
  Calibration, search optimization, long-term planning.
- **Self-Supervised Learning**  
  Masking, Contrastive learning, and generative approaches.
- **Multimodal Learning**
